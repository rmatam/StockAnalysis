# StockAnalysis
This project will attempt to use machine learning to predict correlations and prediction of the stock markets. Primarily NYSE.

To get normalized data edit and use:

python processStocks.py

Packages:

pandas-datareader
csv
stockstats
pytrends

It is of note that the last entry in the compiled data is the most recent date. To get the list of variables look in the raw data files.
